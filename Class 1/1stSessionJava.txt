Q. What is the purpose of learning any programming lang?

A. To Develop Softwares/Applications. 
------------------------------
Today's Agenda:-

1. Different Types of Applications
2. Introduction Java
3. Tokens of  Java
	Variables
	Constants
	Keyword
	Operators
------------------------------------
1. Different types of applications

A. Desktop Applications
		these applications are used in local system only. 
			Ex:-  Notepad, Office Tools, ...
				Billing Software
B. Network Applications
		these applications are used in client / server environment.
			these are mainly used in Org. where data has to be referred / shared with 			multiple people(emp & customers)
				Ex:-  Banking Software
					LIC Software
C. Web Applications
		these applications are used in internet. 
			Ex:- All Websites(Web Applications)
D. Mobile Applications
		these applications  are used in Mobile. 
			Ex:-  All Mobile Apps.
E. Device Applications
		these applications are used for activating electronic devices. 
			Ex:-  Device Drivers.

to develop these all types of applications,  Java, Dotnet, ...... are useful.
----------------------------------------------------
What is a Java? 
It is a general purpose  and pure object oriented programming lang used to develop different type of applications. 

there are 3 Sections of Java

Core Java -  J2SE - Java 2 Standard Edition
				All the language funda's.
Adv. Java  - J2EE - Java 2 Enterprise Edition
				It is meant for developing enterprise applications.
	     J2ME - Java 2 Micro Edition
				it is meant for developing mobile applications and device based application. 

We have different type of versions of java.   Running Versions are Java8/Java9
						Latest Version : Java 17

	All Java updations/Software can be downloaded from "Oracle.com"
----------------------------------------------------------

For Learning Any Programming Lang:- 

Tokens 
		Variables, Constants, Keywords, Operators

Variable :- It is a named memory location to store values temply. 
			these are having a facility to modify values whenever required. 
			Rules for Naming:- 
			1.  Name must be one word. 
			2.  it should starts with either alphabet / _(underscore). 
			3.  Name may have alphanumeric.

Constants:-  These are one type of variables which will not allow to modify it's value once it is assigned.

Keywords :-  These are the reserved words of the programming lang, which is having specific action. 
		Java having nearly 50+ keywords.
			char, byte, int, long, short, double, float, if, else, do, while, for, extends, .....

Data Types :- 

Classification of Data is called data type. 

As per the prog. lang

there are two types of data types. 
		1. Primitive Data types :- providing by the programming lang
			These are again divided into three types
				Number Based  :-  All the numbers can be grouped  but divided into 
						  two parts
							Integer :-  All Whole numbers
								Keywords :-  byte, short, int, long
							Decimal :-  Numbers having decimal portion
								Keywords:- float,  double

				Text Based  :-  All characters is called as  text/string.
						these are again two types
						Character :- 
						either single alphabet/single digit/single symbol
						character value should enclose in single quotes('  ')
							Keyword : char
						String :- Collection of Characters 
							values are enclosed within double quotes("  ")
				Boolean :-  it allows only two values true/false
							keyword :-  boolean
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
		2. User Defined Data types (Non -Primitive) :-  these are created and used by the developer.
					keywords :-  class, Enum, String...
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------		
How to Create a Variable? 
		<Data Type>  <variablename>[= <value>]	
				< .. >  = must be used
				[ .. ]  = optional (may or may not)

		int x = 100;
			for every variable, following properties are existed
				1. Name
				2. Value
				3. Address
				4. Capacity(min val - max val)
				5. Size of Memory

	Ex:-  int x = 100;
	      float y = 12.45;
	      char ch ='A';

How to Create a constant variable ?
		final <data type> <variablename> = <value>;
			
		Ex:-
		final float pi=3.14;
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operators :- these are the symbols which has some action b/w operands.

Arithmetic Operators :-  these are used to perform mathematical calculations. 
				+(add), -(minus), *(multuply), /(division), %(div - remainder)

int x=10;
int y=3;

x+y = 13
x-y = 7
x*y = 30
x/y = 3
x%y = 1

Relational Operators :- these are used to check conditions. 
				>, <, >=, <=, !=(not equals), ==(equals)

int x=10;
int y=3;

x>y =  true
x<y =  false
x>=y = true
y<=x = true
x!=y = true
x==y = false

Logical Operators :-  these are used b/w conditions when multiple conditions are checking. 
				&& (AND)  ==  All conditions must be true
				|| (OR)  == Any one condition must be true
				!  (NOT)  == if condition true it returns false and vice versa
AND Truth Table

T x T = T
T x F = F
F x T = F
F x F = F

OR Truth Table

T x T = T
T x F = T
F x T = T
F x F = F

NOT Truth Table 

T = F
F = T

Assignment Operators :-  these are used to assign value to the variables /  results of expressions are also assigned variables. 

= (Assgining value)  +=, -=, /=, *=, %=

int x = 10;
int y = 20;

x = y; // x and y are value 20
y = x; // x and y are value 10

int z = x+y; // z value is 30

x = x+10;  // mathematical equation
x+=10;     // prog equation

x = x-5; (or) x-=5;
x = x+y;  (or) x+=y;

Unary Operators :-  these are used to increment / decrement by value 1. 
			++ increment by 1
			-- decrement by 1
int x = 10;

x = x+1;  (or)  x++;  // both results are same (x value 11)
x = x-1;  (or)  x--;  // both results are same (x value 9)

these are again classified into two types
	
	pre increment/decrement 	:  if operator is left side of the variable then it is pre.
						++x
						--x
			First Assginment then Action
				int x = 10;
				int y = ++x;  // y = 10, x = 11

	post increment/decrement	:  if operator is right side of the variable then it is post.
						x++
						x--
			First Action then Assignment
				int x = 10;
				int y = x++;  // y = 11, x = 11

Conditional Operators :-  these are used to check conditions.
				? :  (<condition>?<true>:<false>)

Bitwise Operators :-  these are used while performing any operations on binary values
				<< = left shift 
				>> = right shift
				& = single ampercent
				| = single pipe 
Concatenation Operators :-  these are used to concatenate any two strings or string with other values
				+  = for concatenating two strings / string with any other type val.
