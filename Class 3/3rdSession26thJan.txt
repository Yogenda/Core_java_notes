Control Statements 
	If statement
	Switch Statement
	Looping Statement
Arrays
----------------------------------------------
Control Statements :- 
these statements are used to control flow of progrm execution. 
	1. Conditional
	2. Branching
	3. Looping

1. Conditional :-  
These are used to check conditions based on condition true/false some statements will be executed.
"if" statement is used to check condition. 

Simple If :- 
------------
if(condition)
{
	set of statements
}

If - Else :- 
------------
if(condition)
{
	set of true statements
}
else
{
	set of false statements
}

Else - IF :- 
------------
if(cond-1)
{
	set of stats;
} 
else if(cond-2)
{
	set of stmts
}
................
................
[else 
{
	set of default stmts
}]

Nested If :-
--------
A if condition within the another if condition. 

if(cond-1)
{
	if(cond-2)
	{
		...........
	}
}

Branching Statements :- 
-------------------------
This is usesd to check multiple conditions on single variable weather value is equal or  not. 

switch(variable)
{
	case  <Val-1>:
		set of stmts
		break;
	case <Val-2>:
		set of stmts
		break;
	......
	......
	default:
		set of stmts
		break;
}
--------------------------------------------
Loops :-  the process of repeating a task for n number of times. 

there are 4 loops

1. while loop
2. do - while
3. for loop
4. foreach 

while loop :- this loop repeat's it's task until the given condition is true. 

variable initial value
while(condition)
{
	set of statements
	increment / decrement operations
}

Note :-  for  any loop need a separate variable(initial value, condition, termination). 


int  x = 1;
while(x<=5)
{
	print("Hello World");
	x=x+1;
}

int x = 5;
while(x>=1)
{
	print("hello world");
	x = x-1;
}

For loop :- it is as same as while loop but initilization, condition and iteration comes in a line. 

for(initilization;condition;iteration)
{
	set of statements
}

do - while loop:-  it is also as same as while loop but condition will be checked at the end of loop.


variable initial value
do
{
	set of statements
	increment / decrement operations
}
while(condition);

Note :-  if condition is false for the first time, while loop rotate task 0 times whereas do-while rotates one time. 
---------------------------
1.  Accept Month Number then print no of days in that month. 
		solve this example using switch and if
2.  Accept a number then check that number is prime or not(solve using while and for loop)
3.  Accept a number then check given number is palindrome or not.(solve using while and for loop)
4.  Accept a number then print that number digits in word format. 
	123 = One Two Three
5.  Accept a number then find sum of indivisual digits then check that sum is even or odd. 
123 =  1+2+3 = 6  = Even Number
23  = 2+3 = 5 = ODd Number
