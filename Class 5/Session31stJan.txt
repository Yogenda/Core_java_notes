Strings
User Defined Methods

Intro to OOPS
-------------------------------------------
String :- It is a collection of characters/Array of characters. 

1.  String values should enclose within the double quotes. 
2.  To declare string variable, "String" class is used. 
3.  String  class is a immutable class. The value assigned in string variable cannot be modified. 
4.  Character nothing but, an alphabet/a digit/a symbol. 
5.  String value ends with null(\0) value.

String <Variable>  = "Value";

String str = "Java";

String adrs = "Door No: 12/234-A";


String Functions :- 
-------------------
toUpperCase()  :-  converts a string into Upper Case Letters
toLowerCase()  :-  concerts a string into LOwer Case Leteters
length() :-  to count no of chars into a string. 
charAt(index) :-  it will print a character from string based on index number.
equals() :- it check given two strings are equal or not. 
equalsIgnoreCase() :-  it is as same as equals() but it ignores Case Sensitive. 
compareTo() :- it allows to ccompare two string to find which big / which small / equals. 
			if first string bigger than the second string then it returns >0
			if first string smaller than the second string then it returns <0
			if both strings are same then it returns 0
compareToIgnoreCase() :-  it is as same compareTo() but it ignores case sensitive.
concat() :-  this function allows to concatenate two strings. 
contains() :-  it allows to search a substring within  the string. 
---------------------
Write a program to validate PAN Number?
	rules pan numbers :- 
		First 5 chars alphabets
		next 4 chars are digits
		final 1 char is again alpbhabet
			total length is 10 chars and all are the capital alpbhabets. 

i/p :- ASDPA1234G
	Correct pan number
i/p : A1234BCADA
	Invalid Pan number

User Defined Methods / Functions:-
----------------------------------
Generally  every programming lang is a function based language. 
So that prog lang gives two types of functions

1. Pre-Defined 	:-  these functions given by the prog lang. 
2. User Defined :-  these functions created and used by the developer/user as per the requirement. 

purpose of the user defined methods/functions

1.  To avoid complexity of the program, i.e. A big program will be divided into small  no of sub programs so that it is very easy to debug when it gets error. 
2.  To implements Object Oriented Programming. 
3.  Reusability of Coding. 


To create user defined methods there are two steps

1.  Method Definition :- 
		the process of creating a method with a task. 
		<return type>  <method name>([arguments])
		{
			body of the method.
		}

	a.  Method name must be one word.
	b.  Arguments are the variables which recives values at the time of calling a method.
		these are may or may not having a method.
		A method can take any number of arguments.
	c.  return type is a type where a method is providing final result of the method process. 
		Sometimes method won't return any value, at that time method  starts with "void" 		keyword. 
		if function having return type, then we have to specify "data type" of the value. 


	Note :-  A function can be defined either above / below of the main() method. 
	

there are 4 ways to define a function

	A.  Without Arguments and Without Return Value.
		void Sample()
		{
			................
		}
	B.  With Aruments and without return value. 
		void Simple(int x, float y)
		{
			.................
		}
	C.  With Arguments and with return value. 
		float SimSam(int x, float y)
		{
			......
			return <expression/value>;	
		}
	D.  Without Arguments and with return value.
		int Sample()
		{
			................
		}
2.  Method Calling :- 
		Execution process of user defined method is called Method Calling. 
			method_name([argument values]);
		A function called within another function. 
		Usually Main() method.
